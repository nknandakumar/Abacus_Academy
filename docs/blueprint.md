## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#2E9AFE), inspired by concepts of intelligence, focus, and precision, characteristics encouraged in Abacus education; suits a light color scheme.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F7FA). This hue is desaturated from the primary color and lightened for use as the background.
- Accent color: Turquoise (#40E0D0). Provides a refreshing contrast that calls attention to the important information, but complements the blue primary color as its hue is approximately 30 degrees from blue on the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; 'Inter' is appropriate for both headlines and body text given its clear, legible design. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean and modern icons related to education, math, and speed to enhance visual communication.
- Maintain a clean, responsive layout with clear content hierarchy, ensuring fast loading times and optimal viewing on all devices.
- Implement subtle animations for page transitions and interactions to enhance user experience without sacrificing performance.
